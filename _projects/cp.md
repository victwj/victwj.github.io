**Censored Planet**

[Project Site](https://censoredplanet.org){:target="_blank"}

---

To protect freedom of speech, there must be a way to detect if something has
been censored. Censored Planet uses remote measurement techniques to collect
and publish censorship data for more than 150 countries, enabling detection of
surreptitious censorship such as in [Saudi
Arabia](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612448/online-censorship-saudi-arabia-khashoggi/){:target="_blank"}
and [Kazakhstan](https://censoredplanet.org/kazakhstan){:target="_blank"}.
