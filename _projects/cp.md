**Censored Planet**

[Project Site](https://censoredplanet.org){:target="_blank"}

---

To protect freedom of speech, there must be a way to independently detect if
something has been censored. Our platform uses remote measurement techniques
to collect and publish such data,
weekly, for more than 150 countries. The platform has detected surreptitious censorship 
involving [Saudi Arabia](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612448/online-censorship-saudi-arabia-khashoggi/){:target="_blank"} 
and [Kazakhstan](https://censoredplanet.org/kazakhstan){:target="_blank"}.
