[Report]({{ site.url }}/assets/forensic_report.pdf)

---

Wiped voting machines can be found on online shopping platforms such as eBay,
perhaps to recover some election costs. 
We tore apart a used WinVote and iVotronic to write a forensic analysis report.
We did not find any groundbreaking 
security flaws but this phenomenon remains a concerning one.
