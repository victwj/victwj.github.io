**ISP-Scale DDoS Mitigation**  
[Poster]({{ site.url }}/assets/merit_poster.pdf) ([UMich UROP Symposium](https://lsa.umich.edu/urop))

---

Internet service providers are susceptible to DDoS attacks, leading 
to user downtimes and network congestion. We worked with real-world Internet traffic data, 
coming from [Merit's](https://www.merit.edu) 4000 miles of Internet fiber-optic infrastructure, 
to explore DNS-side DDoS detection and enhance the existing network monitoring software 
([AMON](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7460178/)).
