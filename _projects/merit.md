[Poster]({{ site.url }}/assets/merit_poster.pdf){:target="_blank"} ([UMich UROP Symposium](https://lsa.umich.edu/urop){:target="_blank"})

Internet service providers are susceptible to DDoS attacks, leading to user
downtimes and network congestion. We worked with real-world Internet traffic

of Internet fiber-optic infrastructure, to explore DNS-side DDoS detection and
enhance the [existing network monitoring
software](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7460178/){:target="_blank"}.
