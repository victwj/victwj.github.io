					All my project codes can be seen in my GitHub, and I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or feedback you may have. <br>

					<h2> A little about this website.. </h2>
				</div>
				<div class="plain-content">
					<p> I made this website with a mission -- to truly understand and learn HTML/CSS. As such, I designed a minimalist theme and made this website from scratch using purely HTML and CSS. I also refrained from using any "pre-made" code templates such as Bootstrap or anything found online. All the code on this website are written line-by-line in the hopes that it will somehow help make me a better programmer. The idea I had in mind is not to reinvent the wheel, but to understand how it works. <br>
					I also attempted responsive web design through viewports, em, percentages, media queries, and some other elements. Try resizing this site on your browser window, or view it on a mobile device! It certainly isn't much, and my projects page look awfully empty, but maybe it will be filled up before too long. Please notify me if there are any issues or any possible improvements for the site. </p>
