		The div "header-tabs" has children divs of class "header-tab." These divs individually contain the the tab buttons.-->

				<div class="plain-content">
					<p> My name is Victor Ongkowijaya from Jakarta, Indonesia. I'm a current Computer Science student at University of Michigan's College of Engineering, and an aspiring software engineer/tech-entrepreneur/all-around-programmer. <br>
					All my project codes can be seen in my GitHub, including this website, and I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or feedback you may have. <br>
					Please don't hesitate to email me if you want to work together or meet up! </p>

					<h2> A little about this website.. </h2>
				</div>
				<div class="plain-content">
					<p> I made this website with a goal -- to really understand the fundamentals of HTML/CSS. To accomplish this, I designed a minimalist theme, coded line-by-line from scratch using purely HTML/CSS, and refrained from using any "pre-made" code templates. All this is done in the hopes that it will somehow magically transform me to a better programmer. Despite the time commitment and inefficiency, my idea is not to reinvent the wheel, but to understand how it works. <br> <br>
					Some technicalities: I attempted responsive web design through viewports, em, percentages, and media queries. Viewing this website on mobile or resizing the browser window should still offer consistent readability. However, tests have not been conducted on a wide range of browsers and resolutions, so some issues might come up for different users. From a design perspective, the focus is on simple, clean, and maintainable code, with CSS3 animations for some flair. <br>
					All in all, I acquired a deep and newfound respect for websites and the people behind them. My work here is certainly isn't much, but hopefully in the future I will have more to show. Please contact me if you encountered any issues or have suggestions for the site! <br> </p>
