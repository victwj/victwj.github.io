				           <p> Merit Network Inc. operates more than 3800 miles of fiber optic infrastructure, which is the core of networking and Internet connectivity state-wide across Michigan. I will be working with Dr. Michalis Kallitsis to utilize data from this infrastructure for a project on internet security, based on traffic visualization and Python algorithmic detection of anomalies. </p>

				           <h2>Traveling Salesman Problem</h2>
				           <p> A C++ implementation using branch and bound algorithm. Includes auxiiliary features such as finding minimum spanning tree using Prim's algorithm, as well as a much faster but less accurate solution to TSP using nearest insertion heuristics. Input is in the form of x and y coordinates, and solutions consider this a completely connected graph. </p>

				           <p> An efficient way to manage large amounts of input data with strict formatting. Maintain a main log and a separate excerpt to edit and print, supporting operations such as timestamp search, keyword search, matching search, append, and more. Developed with performance as priority, particularly for very large input sizes. </p>

				           <p> Not just simple cropping or resizing from dragging the corner of images! This program uses a technique called seam carving, which can identify important parts of an image and cut off the least important parts (e.g. the gap between horses decrease, the head of edge horse isn't cut off). Coded using C++ with pointers, arrays, structs, strings, and C-style "object-based" programming.  </p>

This program is a basic simulator of the game, with an implemented simple AI. Coded using C++ with abstract data types, object oriented programming, classes, arrays, vectors, and polymorphism.  </p>
