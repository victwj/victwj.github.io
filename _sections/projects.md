**Measurement of Global DNS Manipulation**  
Developed from scratch and deployed an implementation of
[Satellite](https://www.usenix.org/node/196211) /
[Iris](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity17/technical-sessions/presentation/pearce),
a tool which measures DNS interference for ~160 countries from just 1 machine
in the US. Collected data is available at 
[Censored Planet](https://censoredplanet.org).
Covered in 
[MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612448/online-censorship-saudi-arabia-khashoggi/).

**ISP-Scale DDoS Mitigation**  
Worked as a research assistant for [Merit](https://www.merit.edu), an ISP which
operates 4000 miles of state-wide Internet fiber optic infrastructure. Explored
DNS-side DDoS attack detection through real-world Internet traffic data to
extend [AMON](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7460178/), Merit's
high-speed 10Gbps+ network monitoring tool. Presented at the annual
[UROP](https://lsa.umich.edu/urop) research symposium.

**Enterprise Network Security**  
Worked as a software engineering intern for
[Nokia Deepfield](https://networks.nokia.com/solutions/deepfield-ip-network-analytics-DDoS-protection),
a SaaS network analytics, monitoring, and security company.  Implemented
additional security product features, fixed software issues, and improved the
integration testing pipeline.

<br/>
**USENIX Security Symposium 2018**  
Lab-funded attendee at
[USENIX 2018](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity18), a major
security research conference. Worked in a team to prepare a
[lightning talk](https://censoredplanet.org/assets/CP_lightning_talk.pdf),
and learned about new advancements in the field
through presented talks and papers.

<br/>
**Voting Machine Forensic Analysis**  
Ongoing project to study used voting machines publicly available on
eBay. Exploring potential dangers such as recoverable voting data
and possible attacks if such machines are re-bought and used in future
elections. Covered in
[U-M CSE news](http://eecs.umich.edu/eecs/about/articles/2018/halderman-election-course.html).
