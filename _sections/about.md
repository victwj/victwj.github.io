Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student in computer science at [Princeton
University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My current
interests are broadly in computer security/privacy, networks, and systems.

I received my B.S.E. in computer science _magna cum laude_ from the [University of
Michigan](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/cse/){:target="_blank"}. While taking full-time student
course loads, I worked as a research assistant at [Prof.
Ensafi](https://ensa.fi){:target="_blank"}'s lab and as a teaching assistant for [EECS
183](https://eecs183.org){:target="_blank"}.

In the past, I was a software engineering intern at [Nokia
Deepfield](https://www.nokia.com/networks/solutions/deepfield/){:target="_blank"}
and research assistant at [Merit Networks](https://www.merit.edu){:target="_blank"} (mentored by [Dr.
Kallitsis](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mgkallit/){:target="_blank"}), both in the field of
network security.
