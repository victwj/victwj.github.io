Hi! I'm an incoming Ph.D. student in computer science at [Princeton
University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/).

I received my B.S.E. magna cum laude from the [University of
Michigan](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/cse/) in 2019. There, I worked as a research
assistant at [Prof.  Ensafi](https://ensa.fi)'s lab, in collaboration with
[Prof.  Halderman](https://jhalderm.com)'s lab, in the field of computer
security and privacy. 

At Michigan I also worked as a teaching assistant for [EECS
183](https://eecs183.org), an introductory computer science class with ~1000
enrolled students. I taught weekly lab sections, held office hours, and worked
with faculty and other staff to shape all aspects of the class.

In the past, I was a software engineering intern at [Nokia
Deepfield](https://networks.nokia.com/solutions/deepfield-ip-network-analytics-DDoS-protection)
and research assistant at [Merit](https://www.merit.edu) (mentored by [Dr.
Kallitsis](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mgkallit/)), both in the field of
network security.
