Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student in computer science at [Princeton
University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My current
interests are broadly in computer security/privacy, networks, and systems.

I received my B.S.E. in computer science _magna cum laude_ from the [University of
Michigan](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/cse/){:target="_blank"}. While taking full-time student
course loads, I worked as a research assistant at [Prof.
Ensafi](https://ensa.fi){:target="_blank"}'s lab and as a teaching assistant for [EECS
183](https://eecs183.org){:target="_blank"}.

In the past, I was a software engineering intern at [Nokia
Deepfield](https://www.nokia.com/networks/solutions/deepfield/){:target="_blank"}
and research assistant at [Merit Networks](https://www.merit.edu){:target="_blank"} (mentored by [Dr.
Kallitsis](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mgkallit/){:target="_blank"}), both in the field of
network security.

In my spare time, I watch and play a lot of badminton. I'm a sucker for
self-improvement books, biographies, and most video games. I've been playing
the piano since I was five and currently trying to learn the guitar and drums. I'm
hoping to cover up for my complete inability to sing and one day join a 
band. My special talent is being allergic to harmless plants and dust.
I'm from [Jakarta, Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta).
