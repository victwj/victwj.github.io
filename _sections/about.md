Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student in computer science at [Princeton
University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My current
interests are broadly in computer security/privacy, networks, and systems.

I received my B.S.E. in computer science _magna cum laude_ from the [University
of Michigan](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/cse/){:target="_blank"}. While taking
full-time student course loads, I worked as a research assistant at [Prof.
Ensafi](https://ensa.fi){:target="_blank"}'s lab ([Censored Planet](https://censoredplanet.org))
and as a teaching assistant for [EECS 183](https://eecs183.org){:target="_blank"}.
In the past, I was a software engineering intern at [Nokia
Deepfield](https://www.nokia.com/networks/solutions/deepfield/){:target="_blank"}
and research assistant at [Merit Networks](https://www.merit.edu){:target="_blank"} (mentored by [Dr.
Kallitsis](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mgkallit/){:target="_blank"}), both in the field of
network security.

In my spare time, I watch and play a lot of badminton. I'm a sucker for
self-improvement books, biographies, and most video games. I've been playing
the piano since I was five and currently trying to learn the guitar and drums to someday join 
a casual band. My special talent is being allergic to everything floating in the air.
I'm from [Jakarta, Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta), the
[fastest sinking city in the world](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44636934), in no 
small part due to climate change. I hope to do my part in solving this issue, one step at a time.

**Projects**

- Russian Censorship [paper, NDSS'20]

We studied how Russia censors the internet: how it's done, what's being
censored, and what its implications are. Research paper to appear at NDSS'20.

- Censored Planet [censoredplanet.org]

We built a global censorship measurement platform. The vision is that no
matter where you are, you will be able to look up what is being censored (a
list of websites) and how it's being censored. Best of all, the data is produced
without needing any help from each of these countries.
