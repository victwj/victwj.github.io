Hi! I'm a senior in computer science at 
the [University of Michigan](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/cse/).

Aside from being a full time student, I currently work as a research assistant
at [Prof. Ensafi](https://ensa.fi)'s lab, in collaboration with [Prof.
Halderman](https://jhalderm.com)'s lab, for computer and network security.
My recent work includes first-authoring a paper (under submission) and
building the lab's startup, [Censored Planet](https://censoredplanet.org).

I also currently work as a teaching assistant for [EECS 183](https://eecs183.org),
an introductory computer science class with ~1000 enrolled students.
I teach weekly lab sections, hold office hours, and work in a team to
shape all aspects of the class.

In the past, I was a software engineering intern at 
[Nokia Deepfield](https://networks.nokia.com/solutions/deepfield-ip-network-analytics-DDoS-protection) 
and research assistant at
[Merit](https://www.merit.edu) (mentored by [Dr. Kallitsis](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mgkallit/)),
both in the field of network security.
