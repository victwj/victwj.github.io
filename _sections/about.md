Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student in computer science at [Princeton
University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/). My current
interests are broadly in computer security/privacy, networks, and systems.

I received my B.S.E. in computer science _magna cum laude_ from the [University of
Michigan](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/cse/). While taking full-time student
course loads, I worked as a research assistant at [Prof.
Ensafi](https://ensa.fi)'s lab and as a teaching assistant for [EECS
183](https://eecs183.org).

In the past, I was a software engineering intern at [Nokia
Deepfield](https://www.nokia.com/networks/solutions/deepfield/)
and research assistant at [Merit Networks](https://www.merit.edu) (mentored by [Dr.
Kallitsis](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mgkallit/)), both in the field of
network security.
