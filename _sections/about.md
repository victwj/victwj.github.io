Hi! I'm a senior in computer science at 
[University of Michigan's College of Engineering](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/cse/).

I currently work as research assistant at the security lab, focusing on 
[Censored Planet](https://censoredplanet.org). 
I'm also a
teaching assistant for [EECS 183](https://eecs183.org).

In the past, I've been at [Merit](https://www.merit.edu) and 
[Nokia Deepfield](https://networks.nokia.com/solutions/deepfield-ip-network-analytics-DDoS-protection)
for network security.
