Hi! I'm a senior in computer science at 
the [University of Michigan's College of Engineering](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/cse/).

Aside from being a full time student,
I currently work as a research assistant mentored by [Prof. Ensafi](https://ensa.fi)
at the [systems lab](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/systems/) (security and privacy)
directed by [Prof. Halderman](https://jhalderm.com).

I also work as a teaching assistant for [EECS 183](https://eecs183.org),
an introductory computer science class open to all majors with ~1000 enrolled students.

In the past, I've been at [Merit](https://www.merit.edu) and 
[Nokia Deepfield](https://networks.nokia.com/solutions/deepfield-ip-network-analytics-DDoS-protection)
for network security.
