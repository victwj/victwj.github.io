# Personal Website

- This is my personal website! I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or comments you may have. Feel free to contact me at victor.ongkowijaya@hotmail.com.
- The code for this website is written from scratch, no copy-paste, so it ends up being quite simple. It contains many comments for personal future reference, and also serves the purpose of explaining things to those of you who might want to look around in the code. In fact, please do look around -- help me improve if you notice anything I can do better!
