I'm a software engineer working on point-of-sale systems at
[Square](https://squareup.com/us/en){:target="_blank"} ([Block,
Inc](https://block.xyz/){:target="_blank"}). I received my Master's in computer
science from Princeton University on a full scholarship (PhD candidacy) and
received my Bachelor's in computer science _magna cum laude_ from the
University of Michigan. 

Before software engineering, my focus was on academic research in the fields of
computer networks, security, and privacy. I'm very thankful to have worked with
amazing mentors in this space: [Dr.  Michalis
Kallitsis](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mgkallit/){:target="_blank"}, [Prof.
Roya Ensafi](https://ensa.fi){:target="_blank"}, [Prof. Jennifer
Rexford](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/){:target="_blank"}, [Prof.
Jonathan Mayer](https://jonathanmayer.org/){:target="_blank"}, and at [Nokia
Deepfield](https://www.nokia.com/networks/solutions/deepfield/){:target="_blank"}.
I also really enjoy teaching and have taught about six semesters of Data
Structures & Algorithms ([EECS 183](https://eecs183.org){:target="_blank"},
[COS
226](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall20/cos226/syllabus.php){:target="_blank"}).
