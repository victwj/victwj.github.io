I'm a software engineer working on point-of-sale systems at
[Square](https://squareup.com/us/en){:target="_blank"} ([Block,
Inc](https://block.xyz/){:target="_blank"}), which process nearly $200 billion
in payments annually. I received my Master's in computer science from Princeton
University on a full scholarship (PhD candidacy) and received my Bachelor's in
computer science _magna cum laude_ from the University of Michigan. 

Before transitioning into software engineering, my focus was on academic
research and teaching, mainly in the fields of computer networks, security, and
privacy. I worked on peer-reviewed research with amazing mentors: [Dr.
Michalis
Kallitsis](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mgkallit/){:target="_blank"}, [Prof.
Roya Ensafi](https://ensa.fi){:target="_blank"}, [Prof. Jennifer
Rexford](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/){:target="_blank"}, [Prof.
Jonathan Mayer](https://jonathanmayer.org/){:target="_blank"}, and at [Nokia
Deepfield](https://www.nokia.com/networks/solutions/deepfield/){:target="_blank"}.
I also really enjoy teaching and have taught about six semesters of Data
Structures & Algorithms ([EECS 183](https://eecs183.org){:target="_blank"},
[COS
226](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall20/cos226/syllabus.php){:target="_blank"}).
