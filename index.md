Hi! I received my Master's degree in computer science from Princeton University
with full scholarship (formerly a PhD candidate), and received my Bachelor's
degree in computer science magna cum laude from the University of Michigan. I
pivoted from research to industry in pursuit of building products, and I
currently work as a software engineer for 
[Square](https://squareup.com/us/en){:target="_blank"} 
([Block, Inc](https://block.xyz/){:target="_blank"}).

During my academic years, I focused primarily on research and teaching. At
Princeton, I worked with 
[Prof. Jonathan Mayer](https://jonathanmayer.org/){:target="_blank"} 
in the field of security/privacy/policy and briefly with 
[Prof. Jennifer Rexford](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/){:target="_blank"} 
in the field of networking. At Michigan, I worked in the field of computer security with 
[Prof. Roya Ensafi](https://ensa.fi){:target="_blank"}, 
[Dr. Michalis Kallitsis](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mgkallit/){:target="_blank"},
and at
[Nokia Deepfield](https://www.nokia.com/networks/solutions/deepfield/){:target="_blank"}.
I really enjoy teaching and have taught about 6 semesters of Data Structures &
Algorithms 
([EECS 183](https://eecs183.org){:target="_blank"}, 
[COS 226](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall20/cos226/syllabus.php){:target="_blank"}).
Iâ€™ve been incredibly lucky to work with the most amazing mentors, colleagues, and students.
