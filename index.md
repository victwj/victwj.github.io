Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student in computer science at [Princeton
University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My current
interests are broadly in computer security/privacy, networks, and systems.

I received my B.S.E. in computer science _magna cum laude_ from the [University
of Michigan](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/cse/){:target="_blank"}. While taking
full-time student course loads, I worked as a research assistant at [Prof.
Ensafi](https://ensa.fi){:target="_blank"}'s lab ([Censored Planet](https://censoredplanet.org){:target="_blank"})
and as a teaching assistant for [EECS 183](https://eecs183.org){:target="_blank"}.
In the past, I was a software engineering intern at [Nokia
Deepfield](https://www.nokia.com/networks/solutions/deepfield/){:target="_blank"}
and a research assistant at [Merit Networks](https://www.merit.edu){:target="_blank"} (mentored by [Dr.
Kallitsis](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mgkallit/){:target="_blank"}), both in the field of
network security.

In my spare time, I watch and play a lot of badminton. I'm a sucker for
self-improvement books, biographies, and most video games.
My special talent is being allergic to everything floating in the air.
I'm from [Jakarta, Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta){:target="_blank"}.
